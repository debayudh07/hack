# Gas Cost Estimation for FinanceDashboard

This guide will help you estimate the gas costs for deploying and interacting with the FinanceDashboard contract on Base Sepolia testnet.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have set up your `.env` file with:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x_prefix
   INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
   ```

2. Ensure you have some Base Sepolia testnet ETH. You can get some from:
   - [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-sepolia-faucet)
   - [Paradigm Faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)

## Running the Estimation Script

To estimate the gas costs:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/estimateCosts.ts --network base-sepolia
```

## Understanding the Results

The script will provide estimates for:

1. Contract deployment cost
2. Costs for each major function:
   - `updateFinancialData`
   - `addTransaction`
   - `addBudget`
   - `updateBudget`
   - `addSavingsGoal`
   - `updateSavingsGoal`
3. Total cost for a typical setup flow

Remember that:
- These are estimates based on current gas prices
- Actual costs may vary based on network conditions
- Base Sepolia is a testnet, so the costs are only for estimation purposes

## Optimizing Gas Costs

If you find that certain operations are too expensive, consider:

1. Batching transactions where possible
2. Simplifying data structures
3. Optimizing storage usage
4. Using events for historical data instead of storing everything on-chain

## Deploying to Mainnet

Before deploying to mainnet:
1. Run this estimation script to get an idea of costs
2. Test thoroughly on Base Sepolia testnet
3. Consider a security audit for production deployments
